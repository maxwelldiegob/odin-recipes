<h2>Making Spinach Puree</h2>

    <li>Rinse the palak or spinach leaves very well in running water. Tender stem are fine. If the stems are stringy, then discard the stems.
    </li>
    <li>Boil 3 cups water in a pan or microwave or electric heater. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the hot water and stir.</li>
    <li>When the water comes to a rolling boil, turn off the heat. Add the spinach leaves in the hot water.</li>
    <li>Let the spinach leaves sit in the water for about 1 minute. After 1 minute, using a pasta tong, take the leaves. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Immediately add the palak or spinach leaves in a pan or bowl containing ice cold water. This method helps in preserving the green color of the spinach.</li>
    <li>Just add 8 to 10 ice cubes to 3 cups water to get cold water. Allow the spinach leaves to be in the cold water for a minute.</li>
    <li>Then drain the ice cold water. Add the spinach in a blender or grinder jar with chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies.</li>

        Make a smooth palak puree. No need to add water while making the puree. Keep the spinach puree aside.</li>
